## Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate - Course 2
- **Week 1**: Exploring a Larger Dataset
- **Week 2**: Augmentation: A technique to avoid overfitting
  - Overfitting
  - Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting on small *training* datasets (adding image diversity): rotation, shift, shear, zoom, flip, etc.
- **Week 3**: Transfer Learning
  - Inception: pretrained model
  - Dropouts: since neighbor neurons can have similar weights, and therefore skew the final training
- **Week 4**: Multiclass Classifications
